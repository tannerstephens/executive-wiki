	+ Flyers two weeks in advance
+ Don’t do everything yourself, work with your officers
+ In the end, it’s a club, if you’re not enjoying it or feel like there’s too much going on, delegate stuff to other officers. Try to enjoy it and have fun!
+ You don’t have to be on a team to check in on their progress
